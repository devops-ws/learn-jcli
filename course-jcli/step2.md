A course can include scenarios in different directories. This allows scenarios to be re-used and re-purposed in different situations.

An example of this would be including the following:

<pre class="file">
{
    "pathway_id" "environment-usages",
    "course_id": "ubuntu",
    "title": "Ubuntu 16.04 Instance",
    "description": "General purpose environment"
},
</pre>

This would reference the scenario Ubuntu from the environment-usages course.
